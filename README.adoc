= weechat-gnome-screensaver-away

Set away status in weechat based on GNOME ScreenSaver status.

The current implementation expects the dbus-python library to be
 installed, which it uses to query the status of the GNOME
 ScreenSaver.  A future iteration could maybe listen for the D-Bus
 signals related to this state change, rather than continuously
 polling.

== Configuration options

This script reads two optional config options:

=== away_msg

Default: `I am away.`

This is the string to set as the away message as set by this
 script. It is used when setting the away status, and also when trying
 to determine if the currently set away message was set by this script
 or manually.

=== poll_interval

Default: 5000

This is the interval in milliseconds between calls by weechat to the
 `check_screensaver_status` function, which is what calls out to GNOME
 ScreenSaver over the DBus API.
